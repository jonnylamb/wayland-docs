Builds HTML documentation for the Wayland protocol and protocol
extensions.

Usage:

  1. Clone the wayland-docs repository.

  2. Call 'make'. Ensure you have internet access so the protocol xml files
     can be downloaded.

  3. Follow the URLs for the HTML documentation.

Notes:

This is a heavily modified version the telepathy-spec parser:

    http://cgit.freedesktop.org/telepathy/telepathy-spec/

Unfortunately the XML files are too radically different to be able to
share parsing code without it being much more complicated or less
smart.
