Builds HTML documentation for the Wayland protocol and protocol
extensions.

Usage:

  1. Clone the wayland-docs repository in the same directory as the
     wayland and weston repositories (e.g. ~/src/)

  2. Call 'make'.

  3. Follow the URLs for the HTML documentation.

Notes:

This is a heavily modified version the telepathy-spec parser:

    http://cgit.freedesktop.org/telepathy/telepathy-spec/

Unfortunately the XML files are too radically different to be able to
share parsing code without it being much more complicated or less
smart.
